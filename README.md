# Project Title: Movies that could have met a different success

## Abstract:
The project aims to explore the intriguing cases of movies that .................

## Research Questions:
1. What are the key components that contribute to a movie's financial success?
2. How do outliers in our model differ from the general trends in successful movies?
3. Can we identify a global parameter or relationship explaining the success of movies that should have failed ?
4. ..........

## Proposed Additional Datasets:
- [Link to Dataset](#)

## Methods:
1. **Regression Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the significant factors influencing a movie's success.
2. **Machine Learning Model:** Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the impact of various features on box office revenue.
3. **Outlier Analysis:** Examine outliers from the model to understand why certain movies, despite non favorable characteristics, did succeed.

## Proposed Timeline (20 Nov to 21 Dec):
### Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing (20 Nov - 25 Nov)
- Gather relevant datasets, including information on movie characteristics and box office revenue.
- Preprocess the data, addressing missing values and standardizing revenue with inflation.

### Milestone 2: Regression Analysis and Model Development (26 Nov - 5 Dec)
- Perform regression analysis to identify key components of a successful movie.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict box office revenue based on movie features.

### Milestone 3: Outlier Analysis and Case Studies (6 Dec - 15 Dec)
- Identify outliers in the model.
- Conduct in-depth case studies on outliers to understand the reasons behind their unexpected performance.

### Organization within the Team:
..............

By following this timeline and organizational structure, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of movies that could have experienced different levels of success.
